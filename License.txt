1. Personal Use  
   You may download, run, and modify this project for your own non-commercial use free of charge.

2. Free Community Use  
   Individuals, communities, or fan projects may host or distribute this application for free, provided no fees, donations, or indirect charges are required to access or use it.

3. Commercial Use Requires Permission  
   Any party who wishes to sell access to this project, bundle it inside a paid product, or monetize it through ads, sponsorships, donations, or any other revenue stream must first contact the creator (https://x.com/criscrosbre) to negotiate profit sharing or a license subscription.
   - Profit is defined as either (a) collecting more than USD 1,000 in gross revenue related to this project during any calendar month, or (b) charging at least USD 1 (or the local equivalent) for access, licensing, or services built on this project. Exceeding either threshold triggers the commercial requirement even if the deployment previously qualified as free community use.
   - Once a threshold is exceeded you must initiate contact and reach a written agreement within 30 days. Continuing to profit after the 30-day window without an agreement immediately revokes your rights under this license.

4. Attribution  
   Public deployments must include a visible attribution such as "Powered by Tierlist JKT48 by MrcellSbst" and, where practical, a link to https://tierlistjkt48.my.id or the project repository.

5. No Liability  
   The creator is not liable for any claim, damage, loss of data, or other consequence arising from deploying, buying, selling, or using this project, whether in personal or commercial scenarios.

6. Provided "As Is"  
   This software is distributed as is, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

By using this project you agree to the terms above. If you have questions about the license or commercial arrangements, reach out before launching a monetized deployment.
